<center><h1> Final Exam</h1> </center>
<center><p>Over the past semester, I have learned a lot and participated in a bunch of super interesting things in this class. I admit, at times, my participation has been lacking. In the spirit of full disclosure, there were times when I skipped class because I didn't feel like getting out of bed, and I take full responsibility for that.
  Yet, I feel like my overall work in this class, exemplary execution of the final project, and participation amongst my peers when it came to helping them with their classes warrents me receiving an <b>A</b> or atleast an <b>A minus</b> for my participation grade.</center></p>

<center><p><u>Participation Artifacts</p></u>
  <center><p>I found it difficult to log as many reasons as we should for our participation artifacts, because I wouldn't necessarily say we had a lot of class discussion. I shared my ideas within my <b>Small Group</b> and always spoke up when we had group presentations in the beginning of the semester.
    Whenever I felt confident that I knew the answers, I would interject into a <b>Discussion Journal Presentation</b> with my thoughts. I <b>commented</b> on interesting design journal posts when I felt necessary, but didn't want to go overboard.</center></p>
  <center><p>I also participated a lot behind the scenes in ways you couldn't see. I have always been good with computers, and picked up on the coding and html work very easily. When working on <b>FreeCodeCamp</b>, I helped Kelsey a lot with challenges she couldn't figure out. I watched the <b>Lynda.com</b> tutorials and actually gained something from them, and helped the people around me with that information.</center></p>
