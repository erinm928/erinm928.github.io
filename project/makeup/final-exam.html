<center><h1> Final Exam</h1> </center>
<center><p>Over the past semester, I have learned a lot and participated in a bunch of super interesting things in this class. I admit, at times, my participation has been lacking. In the spirit of full disclosure, there were times when I skipped class because I didn't feel like getting out of bed, and I take full responsibility for that.
  Yet, I feel like my overall work in this class, exemplary execution of the final project, and participation amongst my peers when it came to helping them with their classes warrents me receiving an <b>A</b> or atleast an <b>A minus</b> for my participation grade.</center></p>

<center><p><u>Participation Artifacts</p></u>
  <center><p>I found it difficult to log as many reasons as we should for our participation artifacts, because I wouldn't necessarily say we had a lot of class discussion. I shared my ideas within my <b>Small Group</b> and always spoke up when we had group presentations in the beginning of the semester.
    Whenever I felt confident that I knew the answers, I would interject into a <b>Design Journal Presentation</b> with my thoughts. I <b>commented</b> on interesting design journal posts when I felt necessary, but didn't want to go overboard.</center></p>
  <center><p>I also participated a lot behind the scenes in ways you couldn't see. I have always been good with computers, and picked up on the coding and html work very easily. When working on <b>FreeCodeCamp</b>, I helped Kelsey a lot with challenges she couldn't figure out. I watched the <b>Lynda.com</b> tutorials and actually gained something from them, and helped the people around me with that information.</center></p>

<center><p><u>Design Journal Posts</p></u>
  <center><p>There were two design journals that I forgot to submit, simply because I was overwhelmed by other classes. I find that with a grace period, I let myself put off an assignment and prioritize others above it, and knowing myself, that led me to forget to complete two of the journals. Learning from my mistakes, though, I began doing my design journals
    ahead of time, so I wouldn't fall into the same trap. I take full responsibility for this, but I feel this is not something that should penalize my participation grade. Every design journal I did post showed great effort, especially when we were allowed to post videos. One of my favorite design journals that I did was the design journal on 'How to Do Winged Liner'. My small group did a presentation on it and it was fun to be able to share that with the class
    and it felt good knowing that my group wanted to share my post.</p></center>

<center><p><u>Attendance<p></u>
  <center><p>My attendance grade was an 85%, and although I probably shouldn't be saying this, this is the class out of all my other classes that I attended the most and enjoyed coming to. I always felt challenged by the material in this class in a good way, and always made my best effort to come. This was the first semester of college that I had ever had a job, so that can account for some of my absenses.
    I sometimes dropped the ball, but it was a challenge learning to balance a job with my school work and my sorority activities, and that's on me. I missed class the Monday after the elections because I didn't want to go out into a world where Donald Trump was my president elect (yes I know, that's dramatic), and missed a few classes because I was feeling ill but not ill enough to go to the health center, just
    generally under the weather. But obviously, I attended way more classes than I missed, and in class I always made sure to make the most of my time and be attentive to what was going on around me.</center></p>

<center><p><u>Project Execution</p></u>
  <center><p>I think something that really needs to be taken into account is how I executed my final project. I would certainly say that I went above and beyond for my final project in comparison to others that I saw.
    I added all of these pages with interesting content on each one, tinkered with the layout so I could make my website unique, and went so far as to figure out how to include a discussion section, where peoples real comments could be posted to my page. I even added a favicon although I didn't have to, and helped Kelsey figure out how to add one to her website as well.
